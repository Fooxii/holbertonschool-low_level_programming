This project dives into hash tables, how they work and how to implement them, its a personal project to better understand how to use hashtables correctly.

    2. hash_djb2 - Implements the djb2 algorithm created by Daniel J. Bernstein.

    3. key_index - Gets the index of a key using the djb2 algorithm and compresses it to fit inside size.

    4. hash_table_set - Adds a new element to the hash table

    5. hash_table_get - Retrieves the value associated with a given key
